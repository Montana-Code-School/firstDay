//There are tons of libraries out there. Some are shipped with javascript "out of the box" or "natively" and we can use
//them without having to fetch someone else code to use them. 

//for example, in javascript, there is the Date object. 


// Check out the docs on Date at https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_date.asp
// Using dev docs is another skill you'll have to get accustomed to. Use the docs to console log
// the current date as a UTC string
