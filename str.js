//a string is just a sequence of letters, numbers, and any keyboard characters wrapped in quotes. Here's an example
//"this is a string. I think you are cool"

//notice a few things - although we made a couple sentences, it's up to the coders to ensure grammatical correctedness. 
//Also, the white space in between each word is considered a character and part of the string. 

//Make a for loop and log each letter in the string above. Notice the white space and the period.


//finally, "build" a string by adding two strings together. They can be anything you want. Just notice that we can 
//compose strings out of other strings.
